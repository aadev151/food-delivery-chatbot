Chatbot "Food delivery"

This project was created so that people can order food without leaving home. This project is a chatbot for the [VK social network](https://vk.com). It has several functions. Since the bot is customized for me, all the food and restaurants are also customized for me, but this is very easy to change. The bot allows you to order food from 1 of 4 fast food restaurants: McDonald's, Baskin-Robbins, Subway, and KFC. It is also possible to order food from several restaurants at the same time.

If you choose a restaurant, then you have a choice between your favorite dishes and something new.

My favorite dishes include:

- McDonald's:
  - Big Mac
  - Big Tasty
  - French fries
  - Vanilla milkshake

- Baskin-Robbins:
  - Milkshake
  - Frieze

- Subway:
  - Sub Spicy-Italian
  - Draft soft drinks
  - Apple juice in packaging

- KFC:
  - Spicy twister
  - Spicy strips
  - French fries
  - Pepsi from the fountain
  - Pepsi bottled
  - Vanilla milkshake

Also, each dish has the possibility of customization:

- Big Mac: Extras Sauce, Extras Jalapeño
- Big Tasty: No Tomato, Spicy, Extra. Jalapeño, Add. Sauce
- Vanilla milkshake (McDonald's): small, regular, large
- French fries (McDonald's): small, standard, large, ketchup
- Milkshake (Baskin-Robbins): vanilla ice cream, Magic Lollipop ice cream, standard, large
- Freeze: vanilla ice cream, Magic Lollipop ice cream, Coke, Fanta, Sprite, standard, large
- Sub Spicy-Italian: ketchup, Sweet Onion sauce, Honey-Mustard sauce, Sweet-Sour sauce, mayonnaise
- Pepsi (SubVay): 0.3, 0.4, 0.5

- Twister spicy: Without tomato
- French fries: small, standard, large, Sweet and Sour Chili sauce
- Vanilla milkshake (KFC): 0.3, 0.4, 0.5

All dishes and additional options for them are written in the get_details function in the food dictionary, so they can be changed or new ones added to them.
